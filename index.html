                        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                            Linked lists are a fundamental data structure, differing from arrays as they don't store elements in contiguous memory. Instead, each 'node' contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node. This structure makes insertions and deletions very efficient, especially at the beginning of the list, as you only need to update pointers. However, accessing an element by its index is less efficient, requiring traversal from the start.
                            <br><br>
                            There are several types of linked lists:
                            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Singly Linked List:</strong> Each node points only to the next node. Simple to implement.</li>
                                <li><strong>Doubly Linked List:</strong> Each node has pointers to both the next and the previous node, allowing bidirectional traversal. More memory-intensive but offers more flexibility.</li>
                                <li><strong>Circular Linked List:</strong> The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. Useful for continuous-loop applications.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Understanding the trade-offs between linked lists and arrays (e.g., dynamic size vs. random access) is crucial for choosing the right data structure for your problem.
